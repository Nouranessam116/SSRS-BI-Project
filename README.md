ðŸ“Š SSRS Reporting â€“ Practice Project
Project Idea

I built this project as part of a Business Intelligence course to practice SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).
The goal was to learn how to design and deploy interactive BI reports.

Tools Used

Visual Studio 2022

SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)

Project Content

Multiple .rdl report files demonstrating different layouts and data sets.

Shared Data Sources (.rds) and Shared Data Sets where required.

Project configuration files (.rptproj) for solution management.

How to Use

This is a training project, not a finished production system.
Open the solution in Visual Studio with the SSRS extension installed to explore or run the reports.
Publish targets (server names) are placeholders for demo purposes.

Notes

All data is sample or training data only.

Focuses solely on the Reporting stage of a BI workflow.
